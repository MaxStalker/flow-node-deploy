We are trying to create a tool, which will consume some JSON file:
 - [x] create new accounts
 - [ ] deploy contracts
 - [ ] run transactions
    - [ ] with arguments
    - [ ] without arguments
 - [ ] run scripts
    - [ ] with arguments
    - [ ] without arguments
    
Heavily inspired by Go tooling by Eric and Bjartek
